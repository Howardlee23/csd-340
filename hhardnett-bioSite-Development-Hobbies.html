            <p>  Ever since David Dickey was a child, he was always a hard worker who was strong. His family would call him stout. He would help his father with random tasks around the home and would do a great job at them as well. As he got older, he soon realized that he was actually strong and loved to weight train, so he decided to go to the gym after he graduated high school. When he first walked into the gym, the first thing he noticed was everyone was yelling and screaming. Although Dave was a bigger young adult, he was still an introvert at heart, so he was immediately intimidated and walked out because he did not like that aspect of the gym and felt like if that is what the gym was about, then he wanted no part of it. Later that night, he took some time to think about it and then the next day he went again and never looed back. </p>
<p>He finally found his passion that he enjoyed the most and while in college they named an arm machine after him because he loved training arms so much. He would often travel to different gyms all throughout Texas and that is where he met his mentor, Steve Bloomberg. Steve was a bodybuilding/ powerlifting coach and took Dave under his wing. He helped him in so many ways and one day Steve threw Dave a curveball and gave him his first client. </p>
<p>At the time, all Dave knew was that training was supposed to hurt you and if it didn’t then it was a good training session so as he got more clients, he continued to put them through the ringer, however what he didn’t know was that he was actually the reason for their injuries. Discouraged and broken Dave considered walking away, but Steve stepped in and told him to keep going and gave him tools to add to his arsenal to help him with his clients. After a while, Dave became unstoppable. He ended up training the most renowned bodybuilders of our time Ronnie Coleman for an armature show where he of course won. He trained and worked top bodybuilders and powerlifters like Branch Warren, Steve Goggins, and many more. </p>
        <p>When he moved to Omaha Nebraska his name spread like a wildfire and he quickly became one of the top trainers in the Metro. Now, Dave has multiple professional athletes under his belts as well as beauty pageant winners, college sport athletes, MMA fighters, and general wellness clients as well. The name DCT was created which stands for Dickey’s Competitive Training and the reason for that name is because when you train with Dave, you are not being trained as a regular person, you are being trained to be competitive in many wats than just one.   </p>
