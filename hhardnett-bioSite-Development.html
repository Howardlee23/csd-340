            <p> David Dickey was born on February 17th, 1962, in College Station- Bryan, Texas. He was the second to last child born out of six. As a child he definitely had an extremely difficult life. At an early age was forced to work while his brothers were allowed to play sports and have fun. His older brother Curtis Dickey at one point was the sixth fastest man in the world, won the 60-yard dash in the NCAA championship three times, he also played football for Texas A&M, where he would then get drafted to play for the Baltimore Colts and would retire with the Cleveland Browns after seven years.  As for Dave, he did not get that opportunity, his father would make him build things around the home with him and his mother would often make him stay up late while to cook meals for the family while everyone else slept. When he made a mistake, his parents would make sure that he understood that what he did was not ok and would break him down both physically and mentally. When another sibling got into trouble, so did David, so it made him feel as if he was never good enough. He would always consider himself to be the black Cinderella because of the horrible things that his family would say and do to him. </p>
<p>As he got older that anger and aggression stayed with him so when he was finally able to leave the home, he left and never looked back. He worked multiple jobs at the age of 16 to make sure that he would not go back to the place that was his hell. Once he graduated high school, he attended Texas A&M for technology. It was there that he found his new passion weight training. For awhile he was just training from gym to gym but at one he met his mentor Steve Bloomberg, and the rest was history. He learned and worked hard to become a world class trainer. 
What keeps Dave going as a trainer is that there is always something to lean and improve on. There is never a one-way approach to training so things can always be modified in a way that the person can feel the movement and be happy as a client. Also, despite his negative childhood, David is a big giver because he never wants anyone to feel what and how he felt growing up, so he always tries to put his heart into everything. In 2012 his home gym Big Iron Closed down due to the owner’s death, so he was forced to relocate and when he did that was when he founded Dickey’s Competitive Training. He would host bootcamps for people to join and would also continue his personal training business as well. He now has two children that mean the world to him.
